                    scuffs, dust, signs of condensation or mold growth, 
                    this thing can add up to make a home look less than tidy. Theyâ€™ll last for the life of your home if you care for them properly.</p>
                    <h4>3D CEILING</h4>
                    <p>Ceiling do not need much maintenance and only requires cleaning from time to time. False ceiling cleaning process will depend on the material used for the ceiling. 
                    Always make it a point to dust and clean the ceiling at regular intervals.
                    If the ceiling is not cleaned regularly then dust, dirt and soot will continue accumulating causing damage to the surface as well as damage to your health.</p>
                    <h4>4D SURFACES</h4>

                    coughs, allergies or asthma can all be caused by an uncontrolled environment. In terms of air pollution mortality and morbidity needs to be taken care of.</p>
